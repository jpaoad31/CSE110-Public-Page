### John Adams's Personal Webpage

---

Every (CS) person needs a personal page these days, so here's one that I made for myself.

This personal website is built from scratch using HTML and CSS. It uses open source fonts from the font family _IBM PlexÂ®_ in use under the SIL Open Font License. You can learn more about it at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/plex/).

My favorite programming language is C. Most people I know from school dislike the low-level management associated with C, but I think that the lack of extra tools makes it better. Why figure out how to use a built-in list when you can spend too much time making your own version with half the functionality?
