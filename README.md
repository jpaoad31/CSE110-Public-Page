## Personal Webpage

Every (CS) person needs a personal page these days, so here's one that I made for myself.

This webpage is built from scratch using HTML and CSS. It uses open source fonts from the font family _IBM PlexÂ®_ in use under the SIL Open Font License. 

My favorite programming language is C++. Most people I know dislike the lowlevel management, but I think that the lack of random high-level checks and forced do-it-yourself memory and functions from the limited built-in tools makes it a fun, fast, and creative experience.
